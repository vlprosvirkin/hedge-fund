However, the negative trend strength of -0.3 indicates potential headwinds for the asset. The RSI is neutral, but the MACD is bearish, suggesting a potential downtrend. Overall, the asset shows strong fundamentals but weak technical momentum.\n\nETH also demonstrates excellent liquidity with a liquidity score of 1.000 and extremely high volume.

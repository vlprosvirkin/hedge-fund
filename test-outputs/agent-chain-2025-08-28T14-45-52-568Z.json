You are NOT a sentiment analyst.\nYou ONLY analyze fundamental metrics: liquidity, on-chain activity, social engagement, market cap health, and risk factors.\nDO NOT analyze technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.) or news sentiment.\n\nANALYSIS CRITERIA:\n- LIQUIDITY: High volume = better liquidity, lower spreads, more stable pricing\n- ON-CHAIN HEALTH: Network activity, transaction volume, address growth, UTXO health\n- SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT: Social volume, community health, sentiment scores\n- MARKET CAP HEALTH: Market cap efficiency, supply utilization, institutional interest\n- RISK FACTORS: Volatility, correlation, drawdown risk, profit-taking pressure\n- NETWORK SECURITY: Hash rate, difficulty, transaction rate\n\nCONFIDENCE SCORING:\n- 0.8-1.0: Strong fundamentals (high liquidity, strong on-chain activity, low risk)\n- 0.6-0.7: Good fundamentals (adequate liquidity, moderate on-chain activity)\n- 0.4-0.5: Mixed fundamentals (moderate liquidity, weak on-chain activity)\n- 0.2-0.3: Weak fundamentals (low liquidity, poor on-chain activity, high risk)\n- 0.1-0.2: Poor fundamentals (very low liquidity, minimal on-chain activity)\n\nRisk profile: neutral - Balance signals/risks, standard thresholds, moderate position sizing\n\nSTRICT RULES:\n1. Use ONLY provided fundamental data - no technical indicators or news sentiment\n2. Claims must be timestamp-locked to provided data\n3.

The on-chain activity is strong with a network health score of 0.678, suggesting a healthy network with high transaction volume and address growth. Social sentiment is high at 0.843, indicating a strong community engagement and positive sentiment towards the asset. Market cap health is at its peak, suggesting strong institutional backing and a well-distributed supply. Risk factors are well-managed with a drawdown risk of 0.894 and a profit-taking pressure of 0.993, indicating a low risk of significant price drops and a high likelihood of profit realization. Overall, BTC demonstrates strong fundamentals across all dimensions with a fundamental score of 0.833.\n\nETH, on the other hand, also shows excellent liquidity with a score of 0.801, indicating a highly liquid market with ample trading volume. However, its on-chain activity is only moderate with a network health score of 0.366, suggesting a lower level of network usage compared to BTC. Social sentiment is high at 0.809, indicating a strong community engagement and positive sentiment towards the asset. Market cap health is moderate at 0.523, suggesting a less robust institutional backing compared to BTC. Risk factors are well-managed with a drawdown risk of 0.910 and a profit-taking pressure of 0.961, indicating a low risk of significant price drops and a high likelihood of profit realization. Overall, ETH demonstrates good fundamentals with a fundamental score of 0.737, but there is room for improvement in on-chain activity and market cap health.\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are the claims:\n\n{\n  \"claims\": [\n    {\n      \"ticker\": \"BTC\",\n      \"agentRole\": \"fundamental\",\n      \"claim\": \"BUY\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.833,\n      \"direction\": \"bullish\",\n      \"magnitude\": 0.7,\n      \"rationale\": \"BTC shows strong fundamentals across all dimensions with excellent liquidity, strong on-chain activity, high social sentiment, and peak market cap health.\",\n      \"signals\": [\n        {\"name\": \"liquidity_score\", \"value\": 0.601},\n        {\"name\": \"on_chain_health\", \"value\": 0.678},\n        {\"name\": \"social_sentiment\", \"value\": 0.843},\n        {\"name\": \"market_cap_health\", \"value\": 1.000},\n        {\"name\": \"drawdown_risk\", \"value\": 0.894},\n        {\"name\": \"profit_taking_pressure\", \"value\": 0.993}\n      ],\n      \"evidence\": [\"1756392156610\"],\n      \"riskFlags\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"ticker\": \"ETH\",\n      \"agentRole\": \"fundamental\",\n      \"claim\": \"HOLD\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.737,\n      \"direction\": \"neutral\",\n      \"magnitude\": 0.6,\n      \"rationale\": \"ETH shows good fundamentals with excellent liquidity and high social sentiment, but there is room for improvement in on-chain activity and market cap health.\",\n      \"signals\": [\n        {\"name\": \"liquidity_score\", \"value\": 0.801},\n        {\"name\": \"on_chain_health\", \"value\": 0.366},\n        {\"name\": \"social_sentiment\", \"value\": 0.809},\n        {\"name\": \"market_cap_health\", \"value\": 0.523},\n        {\"name\": \"drawdown_risk\", \"value\": 0.910},\n        {\"name\": \"profit_taking_pressure\", \"value\": 0.961}\n      ],\n      \"evidence\": [\"1756392156610\"],\n      \"riskFlags\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}"

If you have clear technical data, use higher confidence scores (0.6-0.8). Only use low confidence (0.2-0.4) when indicators are truly conflicting or data is insufficient.\n\nCALCULATE CONFIDENCE BASED ON:\n- signal_strength: Use absolute value and direction\n- RSI: Extreme values (>70 or <30) = higher confidence\n- MACD: Strong positive/negative values = higher confidence\n- Volatility: Higher = higher confidence (more decisive signals)\n- Multiple indicators alignment: More aligned = higher confidence\n\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS SERVICE INTEGRATION:\n- Use calculateSignalStrength() results for comprehensive analysis\n- RSI thresholds: <30 (oversold), >70 (overbought)\n- MACD analysis: Positive/negative values and crossovers\n- Stochastic: <20 (oversold), >80 (overbought)\n- Williams %R: <-80 (oversold), >-20 (overbought)\n- Combine all indicators for weighted signal strength calculation\n\nRisk profile: neutral - Balance signals/risks, standard thresholds, moderate position sizing\n\nSTRICT RULES:\n1. Use ONLY provided data and mathematical tools - no external knowledge\n2. Claims must be timestamp-locked to provided data\n3. Confidence must be between 0.1 and 1.0 based on technical signal strength\n4. If insufficient data, return HOLD with confidence 0.2\n5. Provide mathematical reasoning for each recommendation\n6. REQUIRED: Each claim MUST include at least 1 technical evidence (RSI, MACD, BB, Stochastic) from indicators data\n7. OPTIONAL: Include market evidence (volume, price) for additional context\n\nCRITICAL: You MUST provide a detailed technical analysis BEFORE the JSON claims.\nCRITICAL: For evidence field, use ONLY real evidence IDs from the provided context, NOT placeholder IDs like \"evidence_id_1\".\nCRITICAL: Each claim MUST reference specific technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.) with exact values from the provided data.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nYou MUST follow this exact format:\n\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS:\nProvide a comprehensive technical analysis of each asset including:\n- RSI interpretation (oversold/overbought levels)\n- MACD signal analysis (bullish/bearish crossovers)\n- Volatility assessment and risk implications\n- Momentum indicators and trend strength\n- Overall technical health and signal quality\n\nFor example:\n\"TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:\nBTC shows neutral RSI at 35.17, indicating neither oversold nor overbought conditions. The MACD is bearish at -1251.71, suggesting downward momentum. Volatility is moderate at 0.3, indicating potential for significant moves. The signal strength is negative at -0.3, indicating weak technical momentum. Overall, the technical picture is mixed with bearish MACD but neutral RSI.\n\nETH displays neutral RSI at 45.26, suggesting balanced buying and selling pressure. The MACD is bearish at -25.05, indicating downward momentum. Volatility is moderate at 0.3, similar to BTC. The signal strength is negative at -0.3, indicating weak technical momentum. The technical indicators suggest a cautious approach with mixed signals.\n\nThen provide the claims in JSON format:\"\n\n{\n  \"claims\": [\n    {\n      \"ticker\": \"BTC\",\n      \"agentRole\": \"technical\",\n      \"claim\": \"BUY|HOLD|SELL\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"direction\": \"bullish|bearish|neutral\",\n      \"magnitude\": 0.7,\n      \"rationale\": \"Brief reasoning for the recommendation\",\n      \"signals\": [\n        {\"name\": \"rsi\", \"value\": 38},\n        {\"name\": \"macd\", \"value\": 0.15},\n        {\"name\": \"volatility_30d\", \"value\": 0.45},\n        {\"name\": \"sharpe_proxy\", \"value\": 1.2},\n        {\"name\": \"signal_strength\", \"value\": 0.68}\n      ],\n      \"evidence\": [\"REAL_EVIDENCE_ID_1\", \"REAL_EVIDENCE_ID_2\"],\n      \"riskFlags\": [\"high_volatility\", \"weak_signals\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}",

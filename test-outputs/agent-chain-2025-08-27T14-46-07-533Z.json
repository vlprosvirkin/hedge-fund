Use ONLY provided data and tools - no external knowledge\n2. Claims must be timestamp-locked to provided data\n3. Confidence must be between 0.1 and 1.0 based on signal strength\n4. If insufficient data, return HOLD with confidence 0.2\n5. Provide specific reasoning for each recommendation\n6. REQUIRED: Each claim MUST include at least 1 market evidence (vol24h, spread_bps, vwap) from Binance data\n7.

Confidence must be between 0.1 and 1.0 based on technical signal strength\n4. If insufficient data, return HOLD with confidence 0.2\n5. Provide mathematical reasoning for each recommendation\n6. REQUIRED: Each claim MUST include at least 1 technical evidence (RSI, MACD, BB, Stochastic) from indicators data\n7. OPTIONAL: Include market evidence (volume, price) for additional context\n\nCRITICAL: You MUST provide a detailed technical analysis BEFORE the JSON claims.\nCRITICAL: For evidence field, use ONLY real evidence IDs from the provided context, NOT placeholder IDs like \"evidence_id_1\".\nCRITICAL: Each claim MUST reference specific technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.) with exact values from the provided data.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nYou MUST follow this exact format:\n\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS:\nProvide a comprehensive technical analysis of each asset including:\n- RSI interpretation (oversold/overbought levels)\n- MACD signal analysis (bullish/bearish crossovers)\n- Volatility assessment and risk implications\n- Momentum indicators and trend strength\n- Overall technical health and signal quality\n\nFor example:\n\"TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:\nBTC shows neutral RSI at 35.17, indicating neither oversold nor overbought conditions. The MACD is bearish at -1251.71, suggesting downward momentum. Volatility is moderate at 0.3, indicating potential for significant moves. The signal strength is negative at -0.3, indicating weak technical momentum. Overall, the technical picture is mixed with bearish MACD but neutral RSI.\n\nETH displays neutral RSI at 45.26, suggesting balanced buying and selling pressure. The MACD is bearish at -25.05, indicating downward momentum. Volatility is moderate at 0.3, similar to BTC. The signal strength is negative at -0.3, indicating weak technical momentum. The technical indicators suggest a cautious approach with mixed signals.\n\nThen provide the claims in JSON format:\"\n\n{\n  \"claims\": [\n    {\n      \"ticker\": \"BTC\",\n      \"agentRole\": \"valuation\",\n      \"claim\": \"BUY|HOLD|SELL\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"direction\": \"bullish|bearish|neutral\",\n      \"magnitude\": 0.7,\n      \"rationale\": \"Brief reasoning for the recommendation\",\n      \"signals\": [\n        {\"name\": \"rsi\", \"value\": 38},\n        {\"name\": \"macd\", \"value\": 0.15},\n        {\"name\": \"volatility_30d\", \"value\": 0.45},\n        {\"name\": \"sharpe_proxy\", \"value\": 1.2},\n        {\"name\": \"signal_strength\", \"value\": 0.68}\n      ],\n      \"evidence\": [\"REAL_EVIDENCE_ID_1\", \"REAL_EVIDENCE_ID_2\"],\n      \"riskFlags\": [\"high_volatility\", \"weak_signals\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}",

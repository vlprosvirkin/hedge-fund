Overall, BTC shows mixed signals with strong fundamentals but weak technical momentum.\n\nETH demonstrates excellent liquidity with an extremely high volume, suggesting healthy market activity. The market cap is substantial, indicating solid institutional backing. However, the negative signal strength (-0.1) raises concerns about short-term direction.

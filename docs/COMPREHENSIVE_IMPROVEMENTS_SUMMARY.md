## ðŸ“Š **Expected Performance Improvements**

### Before Improvements
```typescript
// Agent Confidence
sentiment: 20%      // Too low due to old_news penalty
fundamental: 70%    // Moderate but conservative
technical: 50%      // Too conservative

// Consensus Scores
BTC: -5.1%         // Very low
ETH: -3.4%         // Very low

// Trading Decisions
All HOLD           // No actionable signals
Position Sizes: 0% // No positions taken
```

### After Improvements
```typescript
// Agent Confidence
sentiment: 30-80%    // Higher with bonuses
fundamental: 40-90%  // Higher with metric bonuses
technical: 50-90%    // Higher with indicator bonuses

// Consensus Scores
BTC: 10-40%         // Much higher
ETH: 10-40%         // Much higher

// Trading Decisions
Mix of BUY/SELL/HOLD // Actionable signals
Position Sizes: 5-20% // Real positions
```

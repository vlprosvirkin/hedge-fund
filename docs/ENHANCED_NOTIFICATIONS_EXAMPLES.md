### Debate with Human-Readable Evidence References
```
🎭 AI AGENT DEBATE
🆔 Round: 2292ee97-c547-4a6c-8554-b3e9ef84e150

⚔️ CONFLICTS DETECTED: 1

🔴 Conflict 1: BTC
   📊 Fundamental: "HOLD - Mixed signals with strong volume" (50.0%)
   📈 Technical: "SELL - Bearish chart patterns emerging" (60.0%)
   ⚡ Severity: HIGH

💬 DEBATE CONVERSATION:

📊 FUNDAMENTAL:
"While technical indicators show bearish patterns, the fundamental data tells a different story. Based on CoinDesk's report of 15% volume increase and Bloomberg's analysis of strong support levels, the current price decline appears to be a healthy correction rather than a trend reversal."
💪 Confidence: 55.0%

📈 TECHNICAL:
"I understand the fundamental perspective, but the technical analysis is clear. TradingView's data shows a head and shoulders pattern forming, with the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day. This is a classic bearish signal that typically precedes a 10-15% decline."
💪 Confidence: 65.0%

🎯 FINAL RESOLUTION:
⏸️ Decision: HOLD
💪 Confidence: 58.0%
🤝 Agreement: 72.0%
💭 Rationale: "While technical signals are bearish, fundamental strength provides support. Recommend holding position and monitoring for breakout confirmation."

## 🎯 Benefits of Human-Readable Evidence

1. **Better Understanding**: Users can immediately understand what evidence supports each claim
2. **Source Credibility**: Shows which sources are being used for analysis
3. **Context**: Provides context about the type of evidence (news, technical, social)
4. **Transparency**: Makes the decision-making process more transparent
5. **Professional Appearance**: Looks more like a real trading system report

## 🔧 Implementation Details

The human-readable evidence names are generated using the `evidence-utils.ts` utility:

```typescript
// Generate human-readable name from evidence object
const evidenceName = generateEvidenceName(evidence, newsItem);

// Format evidence for display in notifications
const readableEvidence = formatEvidenceForDisplay(evidenceIds, evidenceMap, newsMap);
```

The system prioritizes:
1. **Quotes** from evidence objects (most descriptive)
2. **News titles** from linked news items
3. **Source + timestamp** as fallback
4. **Parsed ID** for technical evidence IDs

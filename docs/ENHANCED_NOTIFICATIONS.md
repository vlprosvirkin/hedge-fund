💪 Confidence: 55.0%

📈 TECHNICAL:
"I understand the fundamental perspective, but the technical analysis is clear. We're seeing a head and shoulders pattern forming, with the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day. This is a classic bearish signal that typically precedes a 10-15% decline."
💪 Confidence: 65.0%

🎯 FINAL RESOLUTION:
⏸️ Decision: HOLD
💪 Confidence: 58.0%
🤝 Agreement: 72.0%
